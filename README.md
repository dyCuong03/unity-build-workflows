# unity-build-workflows

Docker-mandatory reusable GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, and releasing Unity projects. All Unity operations run inside pinned, versioned Docker containers — the CI runner never executes Unity directly.

---

## What This Repository Is

`unity-build-workflows` is a CI/CD platform toolkit. Unity project repositories call its reusable workflows as consumers. This repository manages:

- Docker image definitions for Unity build environments
- Container entrypoints that invoke Unity in batch mode
- Reusable GitHub Actions workflows for build orchestration
- Build configuration schemas and validation
- Image security scanning and SBOM generation

**Docker is mandatory.** There is no native Unity execution fallback (iOS uses a macOS runner with Xcode — not Docker).

**As a consumer, you own:**
- Your Unity project
- A `BuildConfig/` directory
- A small caller workflow
- GitHub secrets

**You copy nothing from this toolkit.** Your workflow calls `uses: <WORKFLOW_OWNER>/unity-build-workflows/...` and everything else is managed here.

---

## Architecture

```

## Supported Platforms

> See [docs/PLATFORM_MATRIX.md](docs/PLATFORM_MATRIX.md) for the canonical platform support matrix (maintained by the platform architect).

| Platform | Executor | Runner OS | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | `docker-unity` | ubuntu-latest | **Supported** |
| WebGL | `docker-unity` | ubuntu-latest | **Supported** |
| Linux Standalone | `docker-unity` | ubuntu-latest | **Supported** |
| Linux Dedicated Server | `docker-unity` | ubuntu-latest | **Supported** |
| **iOS** | `macos-unity-xcode` | macos-13 | **Supported** (native macOS + Xcode lane) |
| Windows | — | — | **Unsupported** — see [docs/PLATFORM_LIMITATIONS.md](docs/PLATFORM_LIMITATIONS.md) |

Unsupported targets fail with an actionable error message. The repository never silently falls back to native Unity execution.

---

## Consumer Quickstart

### 1. Add the UPM Package

In your Unity project's `Packages/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.company.build-pipeline": "https://github.com/<WORKFLOW_OWNER>/unity-build-workflows.git?path=/unity-package/Packages/com.company.build-pipeline#<WORKFLOW_REF>"
  }
}
```

### 2. Add a BuildConfig

```bash
mkdir BuildConfig
cp templates/BuildConfig.base.example.json BuildConfig/base.json
# Edit: projectName, companyName, applicationId/bundleIdentifier, scenes
cp templates/BuildConfig.development.example.json BuildConfig/development.json
cp templates/BuildConfig.staging.example.json BuildConfig/staging.json
cp templates/BuildConfig.production.example.json BuildConfig/production.json
```

Environment files (`development.json`, etc.) are overlays — they contain only the fields that differ from `base.json`. See [docs/BUILD_CONFIG.md](docs/BUILD_CONFIG.md).

### 3. Add Secrets

At minimum: `UNITY_LICENSE`. See [templates/build-secrets.example.md](templates/build-secrets.example.md) for the full secret matrix.

### 4. Create `.github/workflows/build.yml`

**Android / WebGL / Linux (Docker lane):**
```yaml
name: Unity Build

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [develop, staging]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-android:
    uses: <WORKFLOW_OWNER>/unity-build-workflows/.github/workflows/unity-build.yml@<ref>
    with:
      project-path: .
      unity-version: '6000.0.26f1'
      target-platform: Android
      environment: development
      build-config-path: BuildConfig
      test-level: editmode
      cache-mode: safe
      upload-artifact: true
    secrets: inherit
```

**iOS (macOS lane):**
```yaml
name: iOS Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, release/*]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-ios:
    uses: <WORKFLOW_OWNER>/unity-build-workflows/.github/workflows/unity-build-ios.yml@<ref>
    with:
      project-path: .
      unity-version: '6000.0.26f1'
      target-platform: iOS
      environment: staging
      build-config-path: BuildConfig
      upload-artifact: true
    secrets: inherit
```

> **Choosing `<ref>`:**
> - Development / pre-release: `@main` (tracks latest) or `@<commit-sha>` (pinned)
> - Stable release: use an exact released tag (e.g. `@vX.Y.Z`) — **no tags have been published yet**; check [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and the repository Releases page for the first published tag.
> - A floating `@vMAJOR` tag (e.g. `@v2`) is published only after the first stable release of that major version. It does not yet exist — do not reference it until announced.

The executor (Docker or macOS) is selected automatically from `target-platform`. No `executor-mode` input exists.

See [docs/ADD_NEW_PROJECT.md](docs/ADD_NEW_PROJECT.md) for the complete onboarding walkthrough.

### 5. Add iOS Secrets (iOS builds only)

For iOS, add at **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

```
UNITY_LICENSE                              # .ulf license content
UNITY_EMAIL                                # Unity account email
UNITY_PASSWORD                             # Unity account password
IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64        # Base64-encoded .p12 certificate
IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD      # .p12 export password
IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64            # Base64-encoded .mobileprovision
APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID                   # ASC API key ID (for TestFlight)
APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID                # ASC issuer UUID (for TestFlight)
APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY              # .p8 key contents (for TestFlight)
```

Scope `APP_STORE_CONNECT_*` to the `production` GitHub Environment. See [docs/IOS_SIGNING.md](docs/IOS_SIGNING.md).

### 6. Enable Discord Notifications (optional)

Add a single secret to receive build-completion embeds in a Discord channel:

```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL    # Discord webhook URL — omit to disable notifications
```

Notifications cover success, failure, and cancelled status. If the secret is not set the workflows skip the notification step silently. See [docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS.md](docs/DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS.md).

---

## Local Build Commands

Local Android/WebGL/Linux builds also use Docker:

```bash
# Android build
python3 scripts/docker/run_unity_container.py \
  --project-path . \
  --unity-version 6000.0.26f1 \
  --target-platform Android \
  --environment development \
  --build-config-path BuildConfig

# EditMode tests
python3 scripts/docker/run_unity_container.py \
  --project-path . \
  --unity-version 6000.0.26f1 \
  --target-platform Android \
  --test-level editmode
```

**Prerequisites:** Docker Engine installed and running. No local Unity installation required for Docker-lane builds.

> **Image availability:** Local builds require a published Docker image for your Unity version and variant. If no image is published yet, see [docs/IMAGE_LIFECYCLE.md](docs/IMAGE_LIFECYCLE.md#bootstrap) for the bootstrap process.

---

## Docker Image Strategy

Images extend pinned [GameCI](https://game.ci/) base images with an organizational tooling layer:

```
unityci/editor:6000.0.26f1-android-3  (pinned GameCI base)
  └─ ghcr.io/<IMAGE_NAMESPACE>/unity-builder:6000.0.26f1-android-v2.0.0  (org layer)
       └─ entrypoint.sh, license scripts, healthcheck, python3, jq
```

Production workflows resolve and pin images by digest:
```
ghcr.io/<IMAGE_NAMESPACE>/unity-builder@sha256:<digest>
```

> **Important:** Images must be built and published before they can be used. See [docs/IMAGE_LIFECYCLE.md](docs/IMAGE_LIFECYCLE.md) for the full image lifecycle including the bootstrap process.

See [docs/IMAGE_LIFECYCLE.md](docs/IMAGE_LIFECYCLE.md) for the full image strategy.

---

## Required Docker Version

- Docker Engine 20.10+ (BuildKit support)
- Docker Compose is not required

---

## Versioning Policy

Semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

```yaml
# Development / pre-release — tracks latest changes
uses: <WORKFLOW_OWNER>/unity-build-workflows/.github/workflows/unity-build.yml@main

# Pinned to exact commit SHA — fully reproducible
uses: <WORKFLOW_OWNER>/unity-build-workflows/.github/workflows/unity-build.yml@abc1234

# Stable release — use the exact published tag
uses: <WORKFLOW_OWNER>/unity-build-workflows/.github/workflows/unity-build.yml@vX.Y.Z
```

> **No floating major-version tags exist yet** (e.g. `@v2`). Floating major tags will be published alongside stable releases. Until then, use `@main` for development or an exact SHA/tag for reproducibility.
>
> To create release tags (run when ready to ship — NOT executed yet):
> ```bash
> git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z           # e.g. git tag v2.0.0
> git tag -f vMAJOR && git push -f origin vMAJOR     # e.g. git tag -f v2 — only after first vMAJOR.x.x tag
> ```

Major version increments indicate breaking changes to the workflow input interface.

Current version: **2.2.0** — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Unity Personal / Free License Support

This toolkit uses the **`personal-combined` strategy** for Unity Personal/free
license activation in ephemeral Docker containers — the only reliable method:

- Provide `UNITY_LICENSE` (raw `.ulf` contents), `UNITY_EMAIL`, and
  `UNITY_PASSWORD` **together** as repository secrets.
- `.ulf` alone fails with `TimeStamp validation failed`; credentials alone fail
  with `0 entitlements`; all three together produce `Activation successful`.
- `UNITY_LICENSE` must be the raw `.ulf` XML. Do **not** base64-encode it.

See [docs/UNITY\_PERSONAL\_DOCKER\_LICENSE.md](docs/UNITY_PERSONAL_DOCKER_LICENSE.md)
for full setup instructions, secret commands, and a troubleshooting table.

---

## Docker Image Variants

Images are published to `ghcr.io/dycuong03/unity-editor:<version>-<variant>`.

| Variant | Build targets | Image suffix |
|---|---|---|
| `android` | Android (APK, AAB) | `-android` |
| `webgl` | WebGL | `-webgl` |
| `linux` | Linux64, LinuxServer | `-linux` |

Build variants using `build-unity-image.yml` in this repository:

```bash
gh workflow run build-unity-image.yml \
  --repo dyCuong03/unity-build-workflows \
  --ref main \
  -f unity-version=6000.0.26f1 \
  -f image-variant=android \
  -f push-image=true
```

See [docs/UNITY\_VERSION\_UPGRADE.md](docs/UNITY_VERSION_UPGRADE.md) for the
full rebuild procedure.

---

## Using From a Consumer Repository

The consumer repository (e.g. `dyCuong03/NDC-Unity-Template`) calls this
toolkit via reusable workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    uses: dyCuong03/unity-build-workflows/.github/workflows/unity-build-multi.yml@main
    with:
      platform: Android
      unity-version: '6000.0.26f1'
      project-path: '.'
      build-config-path: BuildConfig
    secrets:
      UNITY_LICENSE:  ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
      UNITY_EMAIL:    ${{ secrets.UNITY_EMAIL }}
      UNITY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.UNITY_PASSWORD }}
```

Required consumer secrets: `UNITY_LICENSE`, `UNITY_EMAIL`, `UNITY_PASSWORD`.

---

## Upgrading Unity Version

When the Unity version changes, you must rebuild all Docker image variants and
update the config. Follow the step-by-step checklist in
[docs/UNITY\_VERSION\_UPGRADE.md](docs/UNITY_VERSION_UPGRADE.md).

The Unity version single source of truth is the consumer's
`ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`. The toolkit default is stored in
`config/unity-build-defaults.json`.
