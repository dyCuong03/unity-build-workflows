# Self-Hosted macOS Runner — iOS Builds

This document covers provisioning a self-hosted macOS GitHub Actions runner for
Unity **iOS** builds. iOS is the only platform with **no Docker path** — Xcode is
macOS-only, so iOS builds run natively on a macOS host with Unity + Xcode
pre-installed and pre-activated.

This lane corresponds to `BUILD_ENGINE=local` on a macOS runner (execution
strategy `selfhosted-local`, macOS variant). See
[RUNNER_AND_BUILD_ENGINE.md](RUNNER_AND_BUILD_ENGINE.md) for how it fits the
Runner/Build-Engine model, and [IOS.md](IOS.md) for the build pipeline itself
(Unity → Xcode project → archive → sign → IPA → TestFlight).

## 1 — The Runner Label

The active explicit-platform flow (`unity-build.yml` → `unity-build-ios.yml`)
routes the iOS job with:

```yaml
runs-on: ${{ inputs.ios-runner-label }}   # default: macos-unity-xcode
```

Register the runner with the **`macos-unity-xcode`** label. GitHub also auto-adds
`self-hosted` and `macOS`, but the job matches on the custom `macos-unity-xcode`
label — it **must** be present or `build-ios` queues indefinitely.

> **Note:** This flow does **not** use the three-label `[self-hosted, macOS, unity]`
> convention (that belongs to the generic resolver-driven `unity-pipeline.yml` lane,
> where `RUNNER_LABELS` supplies the labels). For `unity-build.yml`, use the single
> `macos-unity-xcode` label unless you override `ios-runner-label`.

---

## 2 — Local Prerequisites

Install on the macOS host **before** registering the runner. All items are
required; a missing module or unaccepted Xcode license causes build failures.

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| macOS | 13 (Ventura) or newer |
| Xcode | Matching `xcodeVersion` in your BuildConfig; `xcode-select -p` set; `sudo xcodebuild -license accept` |
| Command-line tools | `xcodebuild`, `security`, `codesign`, `xcrun`, `curl` on `PATH` |
| Unity Hub + Editor | Project's Unity version (`6000.0.26f1`, the SSOT in `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`) |
| Unity **iOS Build Support** | Module installed for that exact Editor version |
| Git + Git LFS | `git lfs install --system` — the project stores binary assets in LFS |

### 2.1 Xcode

Install Xcode from the App Store or Apple Developer downloads, then:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
xcodebuild -version   # confirm the version matches BuildConfig xcodeVersion
```

### 2.2 Unity Hub + Editor + iOS module

1. Install Unity Hub from [unity.com/download](https://unity.com/download).
2. Unity Hub → **Installs → Install Editor** → select **6000.0.26f1**
   (use the "Archive" tab if not listed).
3. Add the **iOS Build Support** module during installation (or later via
   **⋮ → Add modules**).
4. Verify the iOS playback engine exists:
   ```bash
   ls "/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.0.26f1/PlaybackEngines/iOSSupport"
   ```
   If this path is missing, the iOS module is not installed.

The build step locates Unity at the default Hub path:
`/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.0.26f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity`.

### 2.3 Git LFS

```bash
brew install git-lfs      # or download from https://git-lfs.com
git lfs install --system
git lfs version
```

## 3 — Unity License Activation (Preactivated)

Activate Unity **once**, interactively, via Unity Hub. The macOS lane uses
`activation-strategy: preactivated` — CI performs **no** activation and passes
**no** Unity license secrets to the iOS build.

1. Open Unity Hub → sign in with your Unity ID.
2. Unity Hub → **Licenses → Add → Get a free Personal license**.
3. Launch Editor **6000.0.26f1** once to confirm it opens without a license error.

> The GitHub Actions runner service must run under the **same macOS user account**
> that activated Unity Hub, so it inherits the license. Do **not** store
> `UNITY_PASSWORD` or credentials on the machine.

## 4 — Registering the Runner

From the runner package (GitHub → **Settings → Actions → Runners → New
self-hosted runner → macOS**), extract it, then:

```bash
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<org-or-user>/<repo> \
            --token <REGISTRATION_TOKEN> \
            --name macos-ios-runner-01 \
            --labels macos-unity-xcode

# Run as a launchd service (starts on boot, restarts on crash)
./svc.sh install
./svc.sh start
```

Verify the service:

```bash
./svc.sh status
```

In GitHub, **Settings → Actions → Runners** — the runner shows **Idle** (green)
with the `macos-unity-xcode` label.

---

## 5 — Verification

Trigger a smoke build (signing secrets must be set first — see
[IOS_VERIFICATION.md](IOS_VERIFICATION.md)):

```bash
gh workflow run unity-build.yml \
  --repo dyCuong03/NDC-Unity-Template \
  --ref main \
  -f platform=iOS
```

Watch it:

```bash
gh run watch --repo dyCuong03/NDC-Unity-Template
```

Expected: `build-ios` picks up on your runner and produces the `ios-xcode`
artifact. For the full sign/archive/export/TestFlight checklist, follow
[IOS_VERIFICATION.md](IOS_VERIFICATION.md).

## 6 — Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `build-ios` queues indefinitely | Runner lacks the `macos-unity-xcode` label | Re-register with `--labels macos-unity-xcode`; or set `ios-runner-label` to match your runner |
| `build-ios` shows `blocked` | Job landed on a non-macOS runner (guard step caught it) | Ensure only macOS runners carry the label |
| `target platform not supported` / no `iOSSupport` | iOS Build Support module missing | Unity Hub → Editor **6000.0.26f1** → Add modules → iOS Build Support |
| `xcodebuild: error: ... license` | Xcode license not accepted | `sudo xcodebuild -license accept` |
| `No valid Unity license` at build | Runner service runs as a different user than Hub activation | Run the service as the same account that activated Unity Hub; re-activate |
| `git-lfs filter-process died` / smudge error | Git LFS not installed | `brew install git-lfs && git lfs install --system`, then re-run |

Verify the runner's registered labels:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runners \
  --jq '.runners[] | {name: .name, labels: [.labels[].name]}'
```

## 7 — Security Notes

- **No Unity credentials on the runner.** Activation is interactive-once via Unity
  Hub; nothing else is stored.
- **Signing secrets** (`IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`, provisioning profile,
  App Store Connect key) live in repository/environment secrets, not on the host —
  see [IOS_SIGNING.md](IOS_SIGNING.md).
- **Runner service user:** a dedicated low-privilege macOS user, matching the Unity
  Hub activation account.
- **Restrict fork PRs:** **Settings → Actions → General → Fork pull request
  workflows → Require approval** — untrusted forks must not reach a self-hosted
  runner.
