# Security

This document describes the security model for the Docker-mandatory Unity CI/CD platform.

---

## Docker Trust Boundary

The CI runner trusts Docker Engine. The Docker container trusts the Unity image. The image is built, scanned, and published through a controlled pipeline.

```
Untrusted: Game project code, third-party Unity packages
Trusted:   Docker Engine, published Unity images, entrypoint scripts
```

### Image Trust

- Images are built from `build-unity-image.yml` workflow only
- Images are scanned for vulnerabilities before publication
- Images are referenced by digest in production workflows
- Image manifests record the source commit and build timestamp
- SBOM is generated for each published image

### Registry Access

- Images are published to `ghcr.io/buzzelstudio/unity-builder`
- Only the image build workflow has push access
- Game build workflows have pull access only
- Arbitrary caller-provided images are rejected in release mode

---

## Runtime Secret Injection

Secrets are injected into containers at runtime only. They are never baked into image layers.

### Injection Methods

| Secret | Method | Container Path |
|---|---|---|
| UNITY_LICENSE | Environment variable | Written to `/tmp/unity-license.ulf` at runtime |
| UNITY_EMAIL | Environment variable | Used for activation, then cleared |
| UNITY_PASSWORD | Environment variable | Used for activation, then cleared |
| ANDROID_KEYSTORE | Bind mount (temp file) | Read-only mount, deleted after signing |

### Security Rules

1. **No secrets in image layers** — `docker history` must not reveal any secret material
2. **No secrets in command-line arguments** — Secrets pass via environment variables or file mounts, never as CLI args (visible in `ps`)
3. **Restrictive file permissions** — Temporary secret files use mode 600
4. **Cleanup on all exit paths** — Trap handlers remove secret files even on failure
5. **No secret upload** — Artifact upload steps exclude secret file patterns
6. **Masked in logs** — GitHub Actions masks secret values in output

### Verification

The test suite includes `test_secret_redaction.py` which verifies:
- Docker commands do not contain secret values
- Image history does not contain secrets
- Artifact directories do not contain license files
- Known secret patterns are redacted from log output

---

## Container Security

### Runtime Restrictions

Containers run with:
- `--cap-drop=ALL` — Drop all Linux capabilities
- `--security-opt=no-new-privileges` — Prevent privilege escalation
- `--init` — PID 1 signal handling
- `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` — Non-root execution
- No `--privileged` flag
- No Docker socket mount (`/var/run/docker.sock`)
- No host networking (unless justified)

### No Docker-in-Docker

Unity build containers do not run Docker inside Docker. The CI runner manages Docker; the container runs Unity only.

### Resource Limits

Workflows can set CPU and memory limits to prevent runaway builds:
```
--container-cpus 4
--container-memory 8g
```

### Timeout

Workflow-level timeout prevents zombie containers:
```yaml
timeout-minutes: 60
```

---

## Image Digest Enforcement

### Development Builds

Development builds may use human-readable tags:
```
ghcr.io/buzzelstudio/unity-builder:6000.0.26f1-android-v2.0.0
```

### Production/Release Builds

Production builds must use digest-pinned references:
```
ghcr.io/buzzelstudio/unity-builder@sha256:abc123...
```

The `resolve-unity-image` action enforces this when `release-mode: true`.

---

## Fork Pull Request Safety

GitHub Actions does not provide repository secrets to workflows triggered by pull requests from forks. This is a GitHub platform-level protection.

**What fork PR workflows can access:**
- Public repository contents
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` with read-only permissions on public repositories
- No repository secrets
- No environment secrets

**Recommended policy:**
- Run validation and schema checks on fork PRs (no secrets required)
- Skip Unity container builds on fork PRs
- Full builds run only on pushes to protected branches

---

## Secret Handling

### Where Secrets Live

Secrets are stored in GitHub's encrypted secret store (at repository or environment scope). They are never:
- Written to disk outside of a temporary file used immediately and deleted
- Printed in logs (GitHub masks known secret values; scripts additionally use `set +x` around secret expansion)
- Passed as command-line arguments (use environment variables instead)
- Baked into Docker image layers

### Secret Injection Pattern

All sensitive values are injected via environment variables, not shell arguments:

```bash
# Good — value not visible in process list
export UNITY_LICENSE="${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}"
docker run -e UNITY_LICENSE ...

# Bad — value visible in process list
docker run --env UNITY_LICENSE="<actual-content>" ...
```

---

## Temporary Credential Cleanup

All temporary credential files are removed after container execution:

1. Unity license file (`/tmp/unity-license.ulf`)
2. Android keystore (temporary mount)
3. Any authentication tokens

Cleanup runs via bash `trap` on EXIT, INT, and TERM signals. Cleanup failures are logged but do not mask build failures.

---

## Environment Protection Rules

Production secrets are scoped to the `production` GitHub Environment, which enforces:

1. **Required reviewers** — at least one human must approve the deployment
2. **Branch/tag restriction** — only tags matching `v*` from `main` can deploy to production
3. **No fork access** — forks cannot trigger environment deployments

---

## `GITHUB_TOKEN` Permissions

Workflows use the minimum required `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: read    # for image pull
  checks: write     # for test result annotations
```

Image build workflows additionally require `packages: write` for image push.

---

## Dependency Pinning

All actions in the workflows are pinned to their full commit SHA (not a floating tag), to prevent supply chain attacks via compromised action tags:

```yaml
# Pinned to SHA — safe
- uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683  # v4.2.2

# Not pinned — vulnerable to tag hijacking
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

---

## Artifact Integrity

Each build produces a `build-metadata.json` alongside the artifact containing:
- SHA-256 hash of the build output
- Build configuration hash
- Image reference and digest used
- Build timestamp
- GitHub run ID and SHA

---

## iOS-Specific Secret Handling

iOS builds introduce additional secrets that require careful management.

### iOS Secrets Inventory

| Secret | Type | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` | P12 certificate | Repository or `production` env | Base64-encoded, no line breaks |
| `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | P12 export password | Repository or `production` env | Never passed as CLI arg |
| `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` | `.mobileprovision` | Repository | Base64-encoded |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID` | ASC API key ID | `production` env | Safe to treat as non-sensitive |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID` | UUID | `production` env | Safe to treat as non-sensitive |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY` | `.p8` file contents | `production` env | **High sensitivity** — rotate on compromise |

### iOS Temporary Credential Lifecycle

```
CI Start
  │
  ├── setup_signing.sh
  │     ├── Creates temp keychain with random password
  │     ├── Imports cert into temp keychain (cert P12 decoded from env, deleted immediately after import)
  │     ├── Installs provisioning profile to ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles/
  │     └── Writes ASC key to $RUNNER_TEMP/asc_key.p8 (mode 600)
  │
  ├── [Build, archive, export, upload steps]
  │
  └── cleanup_ios.sh (trap on EXIT — always runs)
        ├── security delete-keychain "$TEMP_KEYCHAIN_PATH"
        ├── rm -f "$PROVISIONING_PROFILE_PATH"
        └── rm -f "$ASC_KEY_PATH"
```

### No Secrets in Xcode Build Logs

`xcodebuild` can emit verbose logs. The archive script uses:
```bash
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="${IOS_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY}"   # env var, not literal
```
Never inline secret values in xcodebuild `-xcconfig` flags.

### Scoping ASC Secrets to production Environment

`APP_STORE_CONNECT_*` secrets must be scoped to the `production` GitHub Environment, not the repository. This prevents:
- Staging builds from accidentally uploading to TestFlight
- Fork PRs from accessing production credentials (GitHub does not provide environment secrets to fork PRs)

### SHA-Pinned Actions

All GitHub Actions in iOS workflows are pinned to their full commit SHA:
```yaml
- uses: maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@60606e260d2fc5762a71e64e74b2174e8ea3c8bd  # v1.6.0
```
This prevents supply chain attacks via compromised action tags.

## Secret Rotation Policy

| Secret | Rotation Frequency | Trigger for Immediate Rotation |
|---|---|---|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` | Annual | Departing team member, suspected compromise |
| `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` | Annual (certificate expiry) | Compromised private key, departing team member |
| `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | On certificate rotation | — |
| `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` | Annual (profile expiry) | Bundle ID change, team change |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY` | Annual | Compromised key, role change |
| `UNITY_LICENSE` | Per subscription renewal | License revocation |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Annual | Token compromise |
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_*` | Annual | Departing team member |
