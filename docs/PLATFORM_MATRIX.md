## Supported Build Targets

| Platform | Docker image variant | CI runner label | Docker required | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Android | `android` | `ubuntu-latest` | **Yes** | ✅ Supported |
| WebGL | `webgl` | `ubuntu-latest` | **Yes** | ✅ Supported |
| Linux64 | `linux` | `ubuntu-latest` | **Yes** | ✅ Supported |
| LinuxServer | `linux` | `ubuntu-latest` | **Yes** | ✅ Supported |
| iOS (build) | — native — | `macos-unity-xcode` ¹ | No — native macOS | ✅ Supported (self-hosted) |
| iOS (release) | — native — | `macos-unity-xcode` ¹ | No — native macOS | ✅ Supported (self-hosted) |
| Windows64 | `windows-mono` | `ubuntu-latest` (docker) or self-hosted-windows | Docker (Mono) or native | ✅ Supported ² |

### Footnotes

**¹ iOS runner label** — the default label `macos-unity-xcode` is a self-hosted
runner registered to the consumer's GitHub organisation.  The consumer may
override it by setting the `ios-runner-label` workflow input to any label that
maps to a macOS machine with Xcode and Unity iOS Build Support installed.

GitHub-hosted macOS runners (`macos-latest`, `macos-14`) are **NOT claimed as
supported** unless the consumer independently validates the full build + sign +
export pipeline.  This toolkit does not pre-install Unity or Xcode on
GitHub-hosted runners.

**² Windows64** — two lanes:
- **docker (`ubuntu-latest`)** — cross-compiled to `StandaloneWindows64` via the
  `windows-mono` editor image. **Mono** scripting backend only (Linux Docker
  cannot produce IL2CPP Windows binaries). This is the default automatic lane.
- **self-hosted-windows** — a Windows-native runner with Unity Windows Build
  Support, invoked with `runner-mode=self-hosted-windows`. Required for **IL2CPP**
  Windows builds. Untested in hosted CI (needs a provisioned Windows runner).

## Invariants

| Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Android MUST use Docker on Linux — never native | Reproducibility, cost, ADR-001 |
| iOS MUST use native macOS — never Linux Docker | Xcode/Apple-signing toolchain; ADR-002 |
| iOS MUST NOT run on Linux runners | `docker/unity/run_unity_container.py` explicitly rejects `iOS` |
| Release builds MUST use digest-pinned image references | Immutability guarantee; ADR-003 Decision 3 |
| Windows64 IL2CPP MUST use self-hosted-windows — docker is Mono-only | Linux Docker cannot cross-compile IL2CPP for Windows |

## iOS Runner Strategies

| Strategy | Label example | Maintainer burden | Cost model | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Self-hosted persistent macOS machine | `macos-unity-xcode` | High (OS / Xcode updates) | Fixed infrastructure | **Supported** |
| Self-hosted ephemeral macOS VM (Tart / Cirrus) | consumer-defined | Medium | Per-build VM spin-up | **Supported** — consumer's responsibility |
| GitHub-hosted macOS runner | `macos-latest` | Low | Per-minute billing | **NOT claimed** — requires consumer validation |

## Image Reference Format

For Docker-supported platforms, the full image reference takes the form:

```
<image-registry>/<image-namespace>/unity-builder:<unity-version>-<variant>[@<image-digest>]
```

| Component | Workflow input | Default | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `image-registry` | `image-registry` | `ghcr.io` | No |
| `image-namespace` | `image-namespace` | — | **Yes** |
| `unity-builder` | (fixed) | `unity-builder` | — |
| `unity-version` | `unity-version` | — | **Yes** |
| `variant` | derived from `target-platform` | — | — |
| `image-digest` | `image-digest` | — | **Yes in release-mode** |
