"""
CRITICAL regression test — prevents native Unity invocations from sneaking back
into the repository after the Docker-mandatory migration.

Scans the ENTIRE repository for patterns that indicate direct (non-Docker) Unity
Editor invocations. The ONLY permitted location is docker/unity/entrypoint.sh.

If ANY native invocation is found outside that file, this test FAILS.

Patterns detected:
  - Unity -batchmode  /  unity-editor -batchmode
  - Unity.exe -batchmode
  - Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity
  - -executeMethod  (outside the approved entrypoint)
  - game-ci/unity-builder
  - game-ci/unity-test-runner

This test is the last line of defence against regression.
